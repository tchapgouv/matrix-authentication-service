# Configuration file reference

## `http`

Controls the web server.

```yaml
http:
  # Public URL base used when building absolute public URLs
  public_base: https://auth.example.com/

  # OIDC issuer advertised by the service. Defaults to `public_base`
  issuer: https://example.com/

  # List of HTTP listeners, see below
  listeners:
    # ...
```

### `http.listeners`

Each listener can serve multiple resources, and listen on multiple TCP ports or UNIX sockets.

```yaml
http:
  listeners:
    # The name of the listener, used in logs and metrics
    - name: web

      # List of resources to serve
      resources:
        # Serves the .well-known/openid-configuration document
        - name: discovery
        # Serves the human-facing pages, such as the login page
        - name: human
        # Serves the OAuth 2.0/OIDC endpoints
        - name: oauth
        # Serves the Matrix C-S API compatibility endpoints
        - name: compat
        # Serve the GraphQL API used by the frontend,
        # and optionally the GraphQL playground
        - name: graphql
          playground: true
        # Serve the given folder on the /assets/ path
        - name: assets
          path: ./share/assets/
        # Serve the admin API on the /api/admin/v1/ path. Disabled by default
        #- name: adminapi

      # List of addresses and ports to listen to
      binds:
        # First option: listen to the given address
        - address: "[::]:8080"

        # Second option: listen on the given host and port combination
        - host: localhost
          port: 8081

        # Third option: listen on the given UNIX socket
        - socket: /tmp/mas.sock

        # Fourth option: grab an already open file descriptor given by the parent process
        # This is useful when using systemd socket activation
        - fd: 1
          # Kind of socket that was passed, defaults to tcp
          kind: tcp # or unix

      # Whether to enable the PROXY protocol on the listener
      proxy_protocol: false

      # If set, makes the listener use TLS with the provided certificate and key
      tls:
        #certificate: <inline PEM>
        certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
        #key: <inline PEM>
        key_file: /path/to/key.pem
        #password: <password to decrypt the key>
        #password_file: /path/to/password.txt
```

The following additional resources are available, although it is recommended to serve them on a separate listener, not exposed to the public internet:

- `name: prometheus`: serves a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint on `/metrics`, if the Prometheus exporter is enabled in `telemetry.metrics.exporter`.
- `name: health`: serves the health check endpoint on `/health`.

## `database`

Configure how to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

MAS must not be connected to a database pooler (such as pgBouncer or pgCat) when it is configured in transaction pooling mode.
See [the relevant section of the database page](database.md#a-warning-about-database-pooling-software) for more information.

```yaml
database:
  # Full connection string as per
  # https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6
  uri: postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/database?sslmode=require

  # -- OR --
  # Separate parameters
  host: hostname
  port: 5432
  #socket:
  username: user
  password: password
  database: database

  # Whether to use SSL to connect to the database
  ssl_mode: require # or disable, prefer, verify-ca, verify-full
  #ssl_ca: # PEM-encoded certificate
  ssl_ca_file: /path/to/ca.pem # Path to the root certificate file

  # Client certificate to present to the server when SSL is enabled
  #ssl_certificate: # PEM-encoded certificate
  ssl_certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem # Path to the certificate file
  #ssl_key: # PEM-encoded key
  ssl_key_file: /path/to/key.pem # Path to the key file

  # Additional parameters for the connection pool
  min_connections: 0
  max_connections: 10
  connect_timeout: 30
  idle_timeout: 600
  max_lifetime: 1800
```

## `matrix`

Settings related to the connection to the Matrix homeserver

```yaml
matrix:
  # The homeserver name, as per the `server_name` in the Synapse configuration file
  homeserver: example.com

  # Shared secret used to authenticate the service to the homeserver
  # This must be of high entropy, because leaking this secret would allow anyone to perform admin actions on the homeserver
  secret: "SomeRandomSecret"

  # URL to which the homeserver is accessible from the service
  endpoint: "http://localhost:8008"
```

## `templates`

Allows loading custom templates

```yaml
templates:
  # From where to load the templates
  # This is relative to the current working directory, *not* the config file
  path: /to/templates

  # Path to the frontend assets manifest file
  assets_manifest: /to/manifest.json

  # From where to load the translation files
  # Default in Docker distribution: `/usr/local/share/mas-cli/translations/`
  # Default in pre-built binaries: `./share/translations/`
  # Default in locally-built binaries: `./translations/`
  translations_path: /to/translations
```

## `clients`

List of OAuth 2.0/OIDC clients and their keys/secrets. Each `client_id` must be a [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec).

```yaml
clients:
  # Confidential client
  - client_id: 000000000000000000000FIRST
    client_auth_method: client_secret_post
    client_secret: secret
    # List of authorized redirect URIs
    redirect_uris:
      - http://localhost:1234/callback
  # Public client
  - client_id: 00000000000000000000SEC0ND
    client_auth_method: none
```

**Note:** any additions or modifications in this list are synced with the database on server startup. Removed entries are only removed with the [`config sync --prune`](../reference/cli/config.md#config-sync---prune---dry-run) command.

## `secrets`

Signing and encryption secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  # Encryption secret (used for encrypting cookies and database fields)
  # This must be a 32-byte long hex-encoded key
  encryption: c7e42fb8baba8f228b2e169fdf4c8216dffd5d33ad18bafd8b928c09ca46c718

### `secrets.encryption{_file}`

The encryption secret used for encrypting cookies and database fields. It takes
the form of a 32-bytes-long hex-encoded string. To provide the encryption secret
via file, set `secrets.encryption_file` to the file path; alternatively use
`secrets.encryption` for declaring the secret inline. The options
`secrets.encryption_file` and `secrets.encryption` are mutually exclusive.

If given via file, the encyption secret is only read at application startup.
The secret is not updated when the content of the file changes.

> ⚠️ **Warning** – Do not change the encryption secret after the initial start!
> Changing the encryption secret afterwards will lead to a loss of all encrypted
> information in the database.

### `secrets.keys`

The service can use a number of key types for signing.
The following key types are supported:

- RSA
- ECDSA with the P-256 (`prime256v1`) curve
- ECDSA with the P-384 (`secp384r1`) curve
- ECDSA with the K-256 (`secp256k1`) curve

Each entry must have a unique (and arbitrary) `kid`, plus the key itself.
The key can either be specified inline (with the `key` property), or loaded from a file (with the `key_file` property).
The following key formats are supported:

- PKCS#1 PEM or DER-encoded RSA private key
- PKCS#8 PEM or DER-encoded RSA or ECDSA private key, encrypted or not
- SEC1 PEM or DER-encoded ECDSA private key

For PKCS#8 encoded keys, the `password` or `password_file` properties can be used to decrypt the key.

## `passwords`

## `rate_limiting`

Settings for limiting the rate of user actions to prevent abuse.

Each rate limiter consists of two options:
- `burst`: a base amount of how many actions are allowed in one go.
- `per_second`: how many units of the allowance replenish per second.

```yaml
rate_limiting:
  # Limits how many account recovery attempts are allowed.
  # These limits can protect against e-mail spam.
  #
  # Note: these limit also apply to recovery e-mail re-sends.
  account_recovery:
    # Controls how many account recovery attempts are permitted
    # based on source IP address.
    per_ip:
      burst: 3
      per_second: 0.0008

    # Controls how many account recovery attempts are permitted
    # based on the e-mail address that is being used for recovery.
    per_address:
      burst: 3
      per_second: 0.0002

  # Limits how many login attempts are allowed.
  #
  # Note: these limit also applies to password checks when a user attempts to
  # change their own password.
  login:
    # Controls how many login attempts are permitted
    # based on source IP address.
    # This can protect against brute force login attempts.
    per_ip:
      burst: 3
      per_second: 0.05

    # Controls how many login attempts are permitted
    # based on the account that is being attempted to be logged into.
    # This can protect against a distributed brute force attack
    # but should be set high enough to prevent someone's account being
    # casually locked out.
    per_account:
      burst: 1800
      per_second: 0.5

  # Limits how many registrations attempts are allowed,
  # based on source IP address.
  # This limit can protect against e-mail spam and against people registering too many accounts.
  registration:
    burst: 3
    per_second: 0.0008
```

## `telemetry`

      # Must be a valid ULID
      id: 01HFVBY12TMNTYTBV8W921M5FA

      # The issuer URL, which will be used to discover the provider's configuration.
      # If discovery is enabled, this *must* exactly match the `issuer` field
      # advertised in `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
      # It must be set if OIDC discovery is enabled (which is the default).

      # The scopes to request from the provider
      # In most cases, it should always include `openid` scope
      scope: "openid email profile"

      # How the provider configuration and endpoints should be discovered
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `oidc`: discover the provider through OIDC discovery,
      #     with strict metadata validation (default)
      #  - `insecure`: discover through OIDC discovery, but skip metadata validation
      #  - `disabled`: don't discover the provider and use the endpoints below
      #discovery_mode: oidc

      # Whether PKCE should be used during the authorization code flow.
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `auto`: use PKCE if the provider supports it (default)
      #    Determined through discovery, and disabled if discovery is disabled
      #  - `always`: always use PKCE (with the S256 method)
      #  - `never`: never use PKCE
      #pkce_method: auto

      # Whether to fetch user claims from the userinfo endpoint
      # This is disabled by default, as most providers will return the necessary
      # claims in the `id_token`
      #fetch_userinfo: true

      # If set, ask for a signed response on the userinfo endpoint, and validate
      # the response uses the given algorithm
      #userinfo_endpoint_auth_signing_alg: RS256

      # The userinfo endpoint
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #userinfo_endpoint: https://example.com/oauth2/userinfo

      # The provider authorization endpoint
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #authorization_endpoint: https://example.com/oauth2/authorize

      # The provider token endpoint
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #token_endpoint: https://example.com/oauth2/token

      # The provider JWKS URI
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #jwks_uri: https://example.com/oauth2/keys

      # The response mode we ask the provider to use for the callback
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `query`: The provider will send the response as a query string in the
      # URL search parameters. This is the default.
      #  - `form_post`: The provider will send the response as a POST request with
      # the response parameters in the request body
      #response_mode: query

      # Additional parameters to include in the authorization request
      #additional_authorization_parameters:
      #  foo: "bar"

      # Whether the `login_hint` should be forwarded to the provider in the
      # authorization request.
      #forward_login_hint: false

      # What to do when receiving an OIDC Backchannel logout request.
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `do_nothing` (default): do nothing, other than validating and logging the request
      #  - `logout_browser_only`: Only log out the MAS 'browser session' started by this OIDC session
      #  - `logout_all`: Log out all sessions started by this OIDC session, including MAS 'browser sessions' and client sessions
      #on_backchannel_logout: do_nothing

      # How user attributes should be mapped
      #
      # Most of those attributes have two main properties:
      #   - `action`: what to do with the attribute. Possible values are:
      #      - `ignore`: ignore the attribute
      #      - `suggest`: suggest the attribute to the user, but let them opt out
      #      - `force`: always import the attribute, and don't fail if it's missing
      #      - `require`: always import the attribute, and fail if it's missing
      #   - `template`: a Jinja2 template used to generate the value. In this template,
      #      the `user` variable is available, which contains the user's attributes
      #      retrieved from the `id_token` given by the upstream provider and/or through
      #      the userinfo endpoint.
      #
      # Each attribute has a default template which follows the well-known OIDC claims.
      #
      claims_imports:
        # The subject is an internal identifier used to link the
        # user's provider identity to local accounts.
        # By default it uses the `sub` claim as per the OIDC spec,
        # which should fit most use cases.
        subject:
          #template: "{{ user.sub }}"

        # The localpart is the local part of the user's Matrix ID.
        # For example, on the `example.com` server, if the localpart is `alice`,
        #  the user's Matrix ID will be `@alice:example.com`.
        localpart:
          #action: force
          #template: "{{ user.preferred_username }}"
          
          # How to handle when localpart already exists.
          # Possible values are (default: fail):
          # - `add` : Adds the upstream account link to the existing user, regardless of whether there is an existing link or not.
          # - `fail` : Fails the upstream OAuth 2.0 login.
          #on_conflict: fail

        # The display name is the user's display name.
        displayname:
          #action: suggest
          #template: "{{ user.name }}"

        # An email address to import.
        email:
          #action: suggest
          #template: "{{ user.email }}"

          # Whether the email address must be marked as verified.
          # Possible values are:
          #  - `import`: mark the email address as verified if the upstream provider
          #     has marked it as verified, using the `email_verified` claim.
          #     This is the default.
          #   - `always`: mark the email address as verified
          #   - `never`: mark the email address as not verified
          #set_email_verification: import

        # An account name, for display purposes only
        # This helps end user identify what account they are using
        account_name:
          #template: "@{{ user.preferred_username }}"
